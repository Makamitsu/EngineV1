# EngineV1

Simple Java scratch 2d CPU based rendering engine.
This engine use the embedded java swing/awt hci and buffered image system.
Based on a main loop, every frame is drawn with the current sprite.
A basic collision system is also implemented, a 2D shadows casting,
input management, simple sound player and light map system.

A "game" is included (cf EngineV1.jar) and it embeds all its assets, from
sprites to sound and fonts.
